## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

TIL margin collapsing which happens when two vertical margins come in contact with one another. One solution is to use only margin-top or margin-bottom.

### Continued development

I was not able to add space to the bottom of the screen in tablet and mobile mode without messing up the sizes of the four cards.
